# ¡Hi! ¡I'm Marcelo Mendoza!

I'm a professional nurse working at a high complexity hospital in Chile. While working, I've developed a keen interest in computational sciences. Over the years, I've undertaken various projects both in my work and personal life. Motivated by this passion, I've embarked on a formal journey to become a **Full Stack Developer** and **System Administrator (Sysadmin)**. Here, you can track my progress and my contributions to the public.

## Current Focus

I am constantly setting up servers, improving and automating processes, and performing in-depth editing and customization of WordPress-based websites with a strong SEO focus. I work with IT companies, supporting tasks related to analysis, troubleshooting, and secure environment migration; I monitor and ensure the operational continuity of my servers and i love problem solving based on forensics and the use of logs and tools with a preventive approach; and I set up e-commerce solutions for product sales and online scheduling systems. I enjoy continuous learning and eagerly embrace challenges to expand my knowledge.
